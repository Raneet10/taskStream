# Task Stream


Task stream could be considered holacratic. The objective is to incentivize things to get done.

A user can create a task that they would like completed and attach some funds to it. Then when completed the person who completed the task gets the associated funds. In the meantime if there is an interest by others to complete the task then they can add funds to be paid out to whom completes it.
